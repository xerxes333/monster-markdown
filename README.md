# Monster Markdown

This little tool pulls data from https://open5e.com/ and converts it to markdown for https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/new to create pretty monster lists.

If you want to print the lists in clean black & white PDF add the following bit of code to the very top in the markdown on homebrewery.
```
<style>
  .phb{ background : white;}
  .phb img{ display : none;}
  .phb hr+blockquote{background : white; box-shadow: 0px 0px 1px 1px #888;}
</style>

```



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
